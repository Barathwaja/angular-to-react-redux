# Angular to React
A playground repository that will be filled with educational resources and live code as our dev group (Angular experts) learns React/Redux by contrasting it to Angular concepts. This repository is best consumed by those that have been working with Angular 1.x for a good amount of time.

## Scope
Using the unordered list below, detail how the following are accomplished in React/Redux with reference to the "Angular way" (*code snippets are preferred*):

#### Recommended project generator practices
#### ng-repeat
#### ng-show, ng-hide
#### ng-if
#### ng-style
#### ng-class
#### ng-click
#### filters
#### directives / directive controllers
#### services
#### SCSS integration
#### JavaScript vendoring
#### CSS/SCSS vendoring
#### Development flags
#### JavaScript sourcemapping
#### JavaScript obfuscation/minification
#### Module namespacing / John Papa guide equivalency
#### Global error handling
#### Promise integration
#### Provider decoration
#### Logging best practices
#### Deconstructors (i.e.: $destroy)
#### Folder structure best practices
#### $apply / $applyAsync practices (or the absense of them)
#### ES5 vs ES6 usages
#### Recommended $http practices
#### Data binding
#### Transclusion
#### $broadcast
#### Routing
#### Subviews
#### Dependency injection
#### Unit testing
#### Code style enforcement
#### Recommended documentation practices
#### Code linting practices


## Rationale

_Q:_ Wait... surely someone has researched and documented this (e.g.: [SitePoint: React for Angular Developers](https://www.sitepoint.com/react-for-angular-developers/)), why reinvent the wheel? 

_A:_ Because first-person studies and writing code are the best approaches to learning.
