A playground repository that will be filled with educational resources and live code as our dev group (Angular experts) learns React/Redux by contrasting it to Angular concepts. This repository is best consumed by those that have been working with Angular 1.x for a good amount of time.a

#### Logging best practices
#### Deconstructors (i.e.: $destroy)

#### Recommended documentation practices



## Rationale

Q: Wait... surely someone has documented this (e.g.: ![SitePoint: React for Angular Developers](https://www.sitepoint.com/react-for-angular-developers/)), why reinvent the wheel? 

A: Because first-person studies and writing code are the best approaches to learning.
